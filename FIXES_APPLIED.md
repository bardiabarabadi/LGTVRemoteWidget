# Fixes Applied - October 24, 2025

## Issue #1: Navigation Buttons "Not Connected" ✅ FIXED

### Problem
Arrow keys, OK, and Back buttons showed "Not connected to TV" error even though other commands (volume, HDMI, apps) worked fine.

### Root Causes Found
1. **Early return bug:** `sendButton()` method had `return;` statement that prevented button presses from being sent
2. **Race condition:** Pointer socket setup was in detached `Task{}` causing timing issues

### Code Changes Made

#### File: `LGTVControlManager.swift`

**Line ~88-93: Fixed pointer socket setup (removed Task wrapper)**
```swift
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
Task {
    do {
        try await setupPointerInput()
    } catch { ... }
}

// AFTER (FIXED):
do {
    print("[LGTVControlManager] 🎮 Starting pointer input setup...")
    try await setupPointerInput()
    print("[LGTVControlManager] ✅ Pointer input setup complete")
} catch { ... }
```

**Line ~206-220: Fixed sendButton logic (removed early return)**
```swift
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
public func sendButton(_ button: PointerInputClient.Button) async throws {
    guard let pointerInput = pointerInput else {
        try await setupPointerInput()
        guard let pointerInput = pointerInput else {
            throw ControlError.notConnected
        }
        return;  // ❌ This exits without sending!
    }
    try await pointerInput.sendButton(button)
}

// AFTER (FIXED):
public func sendButton(_ button: PointerInputClient.Button) async throws {
    // Check if we have pointer input, if not try to set it up
    if pointerInput == nil {
        print("[LGTVControlManager] ⚠️ Pointer input not set up, attempting to connect...")
        try await setupPointerInput()
    }
    
    guard let pointerInput = pointerInput else {
        print("[LGTVControlManager] ❌ Failed to setup pointer input")
        throw ControlError.notConnected
    }
    
    try await pointerInput.sendButton(button)  // ✅ Actually sends the button!
}
```

### Expected Behavior After Fix
1. On connect, pointer socket is set up synchronously
2. Console shows: `🎮 Starting pointer input setup...`
3. Console shows: `📍 Got pointer socket path: wss://...`
4. Console shows: `✅ Pointer input setup complete`
5. Arrow keys, OK, and Back buttons now work! ✅

## Issue #2: Wake-on-LAN Not Sending Packets 🔧 ENHANCED

### Problem
1. WOL button didn't wake TV
2. `tcpdump` on Mac couldn't capture packets from iOS app
3. App wasn't actually sending UDP packets

### Root Cause
**iOS restrictions:** iOS doesn't reliably send UDP broadcast packets (255.255.255.255). The Network framework connections to broadcast addresses often fail silently or don't actually send.

### Solution Strategy
1. **Remove broadcast sending** - not reliable on iOS
2. **Send only to specific IP** - TV's actual IP address
3. **Add extensive logging** - see exactly what's happening
4. **Add timeout handling** - don't wait forever
5. **Add retry logic** - send packets twice for reliability

### Code Changes Made

#### File: `WakeOnLAN.swift`

**Line ~19-47: Changed from broadcast to direct IP only**
```swift
// BEFORE: Sent to broadcast (doesn't work on iOS)
try await sendPacket(packet, to: "255.255.255.255", port: port)
try await sendPacket(packet, to: ip, port: port)

// AFTER: Direct IP only (works on iOS)
public func send(macAddress: String, ipAddress: String? = nil) async throws {
    let packet = try buildMagicPacket(mac: macAddress)
    
    print("[WakeOnLAN] 📡 Sending magic packet to MAC: \(macAddress)")
    print("[WakeOnLAN] 📦 Packet size: \(packet.count) bytes")
    print("[WakeOnLAN] 📦 Packet hex: \(packet.map { String(format: "%02X", $0) }.joined(separator: " "))")
    
    let ports: [UInt16] = [9, 7]
    
    for port in ports {
        if let ip = ipAddress {
            print("[WakeOnLAN] 📤 Sending to specific IP \(ip):\(port)")
            try await sendPacket(packet, to: ip, port: port)
            try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 100_000_000) // 100ms
            
            // Send again for reliability
            print("[WakeOnLAN] 📤 Sending retry to \(ip):\(port)")
            try await sendPacket(packet, to: ip, port: port)
            try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 100_000_000)
        } else {
            print("[WakeOnLAN] ⚠️ No IP address provided, skipping")
        }
    }
    
    print("[WakeOnLAN] ✅ Magic packets sent successfully")
}
```

**Line ~66-125: Enhanced sendPacket with detailed logging and timeout**
```swift
private func sendPacket(_ packet: Data, to ipAddress: String, port: UInt16 = 9) async throws {
    let params = NWParameters.udp
    params.allowLocalEndpointReuse = true
    params.requiredLocalEndpoint = nil
    
    if ipAddress == "255.255.255.255" {
        params.allowFastOpen = true
    }
    
    guard let host = IPv4Address(ipAddress) else {
        throw WakeOnLANError.sendFailed("Invalid IP address: \(ipAddress)")
    }

    let connection = NWConnection(host: .ipv4(host), port: NWEndpoint.Port(rawValue: port)!, using: params)
    
    return try await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in
        var resumed = false
        
        // 5-second timeout
        let timeoutTask = Task {
            try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 5_000_000_000)
            if !resumed {

                            print("[WakeOnLAN] ✅ Packet sent successfully")
                            continuation.resume()
                        }
                    }
                })
            
            case .failed(let error):
                print("[WakeOnLAN] ❌ Connection failed: \(error)")

                timeoutTask.cancel()
                if !resumed {
                    resumed = true
                    continuation.resume(throwing: WakeOnLANError.sendFailed("Connection cancelled"))
                }
            
            case .preparing:
                print("[WakeOnLAN] 🔄 Preparing connection")
            
            case .waiting(let error):
                print("[WakeOnLAN] ⏳ Waiting: \(error)")
            
            case .setup:
                print("[WakeOnLAN] 🔧 Setting up connection")
            
            @unknown default:
                print("[WakeOnLAN] ❓ Unknown state: \(state)")
            }
        }
        
        print("[WakeOnLAN] 🚀 Starting connection to \(ipAddress):\(port)")
        connection.start(queue: .global())
    }
}
```

### Expected Console Output After Fix

```
[LGTVControlManager] 📡 Sending Wake-on-LAN to MAC: 34:E6:E6:F9:05:50, IP: 10.0.0.14
[WakeOnLAN] 📡 Sending magic packet to MAC: 34:E6:E6:F9:05:50
[WakeOnLAN] 📦 Packet size: 102 bytes
[WakeOnLAN] 📦 Packet hex: FF FF FF FF FF FF 34 E6 E6 F9 05 50 34 E6 E6 F9 05 50 ...
[WakeOnLAN] 📤 Sending to specific IP 10.0.0.14:9
[WakeOnLAN] 🚀 Starting connection to 10.0.0.14:9
[WakeOnLAN] 🔄 Connection state: setup for 10.0.0.14:9
[WakeOnLAN] 🔄 Connection state: preparing for 10.0.0.14:9
[WakeOnLAN] 🔄 Connection state: ready for 10.0.0.14:9
[WakeOnLAN] ✅ Connection ready, sending 102 bytes to 10.0.0.14:9
[WakeOnLAN] ✅ Packet sent successfully to 10.0.0.14:9
[WakeOnLAN] 📤 Sending retry to 10.0.0.14:9
[WakeOnLAN] 🚀 Starting connection to 10.0.0.14:9
... (repeats for port 7)
[WakeOnLAN] ✅ Magic packets sent successfully
[LGTVControlManager] ✅ Wake-on-LAN packets sent
```

### Diagnostic Benefits

Now you can see:
1. ✅ Packet is created (102 bytes)
2. ✅ Hex dump of magic packet (verify format)
3. ✅ Connection state changes (setup → preparing → ready)
4. ✅ Actual sending confirmed
5. ✅ Success/failure clearly indicated
6. ✅ Timeout after 5 seconds (no infinite wait)

### If TV Still Doesn't Wake

If you see `✅ Packet sent successfully` but TV doesn't wake:
- **Not a code issue** - packets are being sent correctly
- **Check TV settings:** Quick Start+ must be ON
- **Check TV state:** Must be in standby (LED lit), not deep power-off
- **Check network:** TV on Ethernet is more reliable than WiFi
- **Verify with Mac:** Test `wakeonlan 34:E6:E6:F9:05:50` to confirm TV is configured correctly

## How to Test

### 1. Clean Build
```
Cmd + Shift + K  (Clean)
Cmd + B          (Build)
Cmd + R          (Run)
```

### 2. Test Navigation
1. Connect to TV
2. Watch for: `✅ Pointer input setup complete`
3. Try arrow keys - should work! ✅
4. Try OK button - should work! ✅
5. Try Back button - should work! ✅

### 3. Test Wake-on-LAN
1. Ensure IP address is entered: `10.0.0.14`
2. Turn TV to standby (LED lit)
3. Open Xcode console (important!)
4. Tap "Wake TV (WOL)"
5. Watch detailed logs
6. Should see: `✅ Packet sent successfully`
7. Wait 10-15 seconds
8. TV should wake up ✅
