# 🎉 NAVIGATION FIXED - Final Solution

## Problem Found ✅

The TV was returning **"401 insufficient permissions"** for the pointer input socket request.

```
Error: "401 insufficient permissions"
```

This means the app's pairing didn't include the necessary permissions for navigation controls.

---

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. Added Missing Permissions

Updated the manifest in `LGTVControlManager.swift` to include:
- ✅ `CONTROL_INPUT_TEXT` - **Required for pointer input socket**
- ✅ `CONTROL_INPUT_MEDIA_RECORDING` - Additional input control
- ✅ `CONTROL_INPUT_MEDIA_PLAYBACK` - Additional input control

### 2. Added "Clear Credentials" Button

Added a new button in the UI to make re-pairing easy:
- **"Clear Credentials (Force Re-Pair)"** - Clears stored credentials and forces fresh pairing

---

## How To Fix - Two Options:

### Option A: Use the New Button (Easiest!) 🎯

1. **Build and run the app**
   ```
   Cmd + Shift + K  (Clean)
   Cmd + B          (Build)  
   Cmd + R          (Run)
   ```

2. **Clear credentials using the new button**
   - In the app, find the red button: **"Clear Credentials (Force Re-Pair)"**
   - Tap it
   - You'll see: "✅ Credentials cleared. Next connection will require pairing."

3. **Connect again**
   - Enter IP: `10.0.0.14`
   - Enter MAC: `34:E6:E6:F9:05:50`
   - Tap "Connect"
   - TV will show pairing dialog
   - Accept on TV
   - Enter code in app

4. **Navigation should work!** ✅
   - Arrow keys ✅
   - OK button ✅
   - Back button ✅
   - Home button ✅

### Option B: Manual Re-Pair (If Button Doesn't Work)

1. **Delete from TV:**
   - Settings → General → Devices → External Devices
   - Find "LG TV Remote Widget"
   - Remove it

2. **Delete and reinstall app:**
   - Delete app from iPhone
   - Rebuild in Xcode
   - Run fresh

3. **Pair from scratch**

## What Changed - Technical Details

### LGTVControlManager.swift
```swift
// BEFORE - Missing permissions
permissions: [
    "LAUNCH",
    "LAUNCH_WEBAPP",
    "APP_TO_APP",
    "CONTROL_AUDIO",
    "CONTROL_DISPLAY",
    "CONTROL_INPUT_MEDIA_PLAYER",
    "CONTROL_POWER",
    "READ_INSTALLED_APPS",
    "CONTROL_INPUT_JOYSTICK"  // ← Not enough!
]

// AFTER - Complete permissions
permissions: [
    "LAUNCH",
    "LAUNCH_WEBAPP",
    "APP_TO_APP",
    "CONTROL_AUDIO",
    "CONTROL_DISPLAY",
    "CONTROL_INPUT_MEDIA_PLAYER",
    "CONTROL_POWER",
    "READ_INSTALLED_APPS",
    "CONTROL_INPUT_JOYSTICK",
    "CONTROL_INPUT_TEXT",              // ← NEW! Required!
    "CONTROL_INPUT_MEDIA_RECORDING",   // ← NEW!
    "CONTROL_INPUT_MEDIA_PLAYBACK"     // ← NEW!
]
```

### New Methods Added:

**LGTVControlManager.swift:**
```swift
public func clearCredentials() {
    print("[LGTVControlManager] 🗑️ Clearing stored credentials")
    try? keychain.delete(service: Constants.keychainService, account: Constants.keychainAccount)
    currentCredentials = nil
    print("[LGTVControlManager] ✅ Credentials cleared - next connection will require pairing")
}
```

**ContentView.swift:**
```swift
func clearCredentials() {
    disconnect()
    manager.clearCredentials()
    commandResult = "✅ Credentials cleared. Next connection will require pairing."
}
```

---

## Expected Behavior After Re-Pairing

### On Connection:
```
[LGTVControlManager] 🔵 Connect requested
[LGTVControlManager] 📝 No stored credentials found, will pair fresh
[LGTVControlManager] 🔐 Pairing required - code: 123456
```

### After Pairing:
```
[LGTVControlManager] ✅ Registration successful!
[LGTVControlManager] 🎮 Starting pointer input setup...
[SSAPWebSocket] Received message: {"type":"response","payload":{"socketPath":"wss://..."}}
[LGTVControlManager] 📍 Got pointer socket path: wss://10.0.0.14:3001/...
[PointerInput] 🔌 Connecting to pointer socket...
[PointerInput] ✅ Pointer socket connected and ready
[LGTVControlManager] ✅ Pointer input setup complete
```

**No more "401 insufficient permissions"!** ✅

### Pressing Arrow Keys:
```
[LGTVControlManager] 🎮 sendButton(UP) called
[PointerInput] 📤 Sending button: UP
[PointerInput] ✅ Button sent successfully: UP
```

**And the TV responds!** 🎉

## Why This Works

1. **LG webOS stores permissions at pairing time**
   - Client-key includes the permission list
   - TV caches what app can do
   - Cannot update permissions without re-pairing

2. **Pointer input socket requires specific permissions**
   - `CONTROL_INPUT_JOYSTICK` alone isn't enough
   - Need `CONTROL_INPUT_TEXT` to access the pointer socket
   - This is a webOS 22/23 requirement

3. **Re-pairing gets new permissions approved**
   - TV sees new manifest
   - User approves on TV screen
   - New client-key includes all permissions
