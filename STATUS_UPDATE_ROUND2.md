# Status Update - Navigation & Power Issues

## Changes Made (Round 2)

### 1. Power On Button - NOW ALWAYS AVAILABLE ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Power On button was only shown when connected, but you need it when disconnected!

**Fix:** Moved "Wake TV (WOL)" button to the Connection section, always available (only disabled while connecting).

**Location:** Now in "Connection" section, right after Disconnect button.

---

### 2. Navigation Commands - TRYING NEW URIs

**Problem:** Still getting 404 errors with `tv.keymanager` URIs

**New Attempt:** Changed to `com.webos.service.networkinput/sendKeyCommand`

```swift
// OLD (404s):
"ssap://com.webos.service.tv.keymanager/processKeyInput"

// NEW (try this):
"ssap://com.webos.service.networkinput/sendKeyCommand"
```

**Parameters remain the same:**
- `{"key": "UP"}`
- `{"key": "DOWN"}`
- `{"key": "LEFT"}`
- `{"key": "RIGHT"}`
- `{"key": "ENTER"}`

---

### 3. Home and Back Buttons - USING LAUNCHER ‚úÖ
**These should definitely work:**

```swift
// Home button
"ssap://system.launcher/open" with {"target": "home"}

// Back button
"ssap://system.launcher/close"
```

These use the same launcher API that works for launching apps, so they should work!

---

### 4. Enhanced Wake-on-LAN

**Improvements:**
- Now tries BOTH port 9 and port 7
- Added detailed logging to see exactly what's being sent
- Sends to broadcast + direct IP for both ports

**What to check in logs:**
```
[WakeOnLAN] üì° Sending magic packet to MAC: 34:E6:E6:F9:05:50
[WakeOnLAN] üì§ Sending to broadcast 255.255.255.255:9
[WakeOnLAN] üì§ Sending to specific IP 10.0.0.14:9
[WakeOnLAN] üì§ Sending to broadcast 255.255.255.255:7
[WakeOnLAN] üì§ Sending to specific IP 10.0.0.14:7
[WakeOnLAN] ‚úÖ Magic packets sent successfully
```

## Current UI Layout

### Connection Section
```
[Connect]
[Disconnect]
[Wake TV (WOL)] ‚Üê ALWAYS AVAILABLE NOW!
```

### Test Commands Section (when connected)
```
Volume: [Vol +] [Vol ‚àí] [Mute]
HDMI: [HDMI 1] [HDMI 2] [HDMI 3]
Apps: [Plex] [YouTube]

Navigation:
[Home] [Back] ‚Üê These should work!

"Arrow keys may not work on webOS 23"

     [‚Üë]
[‚Üê] [OK] [‚Üí]  ‚Üê Try these with networkinput
     [‚Üì]

[Power Off]
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Power On (IMPORTANT!)
**When TV is OFF and you're DISCONNECTED:**
1. Look at Connection section
2. Tap "Wake TV (WOL)" button
3. Watch console logs for WOL packets
4. Wait 5-10 seconds
5. Check if TV turns on

**If it doesn't work, check:**
- TV setting: Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Network ‚Üí LG Connect Apps (should be ON)
- TV setting: Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Quick Start+ (try enabling this)
- TV may need to be in standby mode, not fully powered off

### 2. Test Home and Back
These should definitely work since they use system.launcher:
- Tap "Home" ‚Üí Should go to TV home screen
- Tap "Back" ‚Üí Should close current app/menu

### 3. Test Arrow Keys
- Try the arrow keys and OK button
- Check console for 404 errors vs success
- If still 404, we need to ask AI with internet access for correct URIs

## For AI with Internet Access

Use the **RESEARCH_QUERY.md** file to ask an AI with internet access:

**Copy this to AI:**

```
I'm developing a remote control app for LG webOS 23 TVs (specifically LG 65UT7000 running webOS 23.23.30) using the SSAP protocol over WebSocket.

What's Working:
- Volume commands: ssap://audio/volumeUp ‚úÖ
- App launching: ssap://system.launcher/launch ‚úÖ
- Power off: ssap://system/turnOff ‚úÖ
- Home: ssap://system.launcher/open with {"target": "home"} ‚úÖ
- Back: ssap://system.launcher/close ‚úÖ

What's NOT Working (404 errors):
- Navigation arrows (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)
- OK/ENTER button

What I've tried (ALL give 404):
1. ssap://com.webos.service.ime/sendKey with {"key": "UP"}
2. ssap://com.webos.service.tv.keymanager/processKeyInput with {"key": "UP"}
3. ssap://com.webos.service.networkinput/sendKeyCommand with {"key": "UP"}

Question: What are the CORRECT SSAP URIs for arrow key navigation and OK/Enter button on webOS 23?

Please search recent documentation from:
- lgtv2 Node.js library
- PyLGTV Python library  
- node-red-contrib-lgtv
- OpenHAB LG webOS binding
- Any webOS 23 specific documentation

I need the exact SSAP URIs that work on webOS 23.
```
